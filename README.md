# IITB-CPU
Design a computing system, IITB-CPU, whose instruction set architecture is provided. Use VHDL
as HDL to implement. IITB-CPU is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the teaching
purpose. The IITB-CPU is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system, i.e., it can process 16 bits at a
time. It should use point-to-point communication infrastructure.
